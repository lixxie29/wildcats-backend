UrbanWanderlust is a versatile web application designed to aid users in both assessing the cost of living and planning travel. The app provides a comprehensive, paid section dedicated to living expenses, which includes data on rental housing prices, salaries, car rentals, restaurant costs, grocery expenses, and transportation details for various cities. This section is essential for those considering relocation or wanting to understand the economic landscape of a new city.

In contrast, the travel portion of the app is available for free. It integrates functionalities for booking flights and accommodations (through services like Booking.com and Airbnb), and it utilizes the cost of living data to provide context for travel planning. 

The user interface of UrbanWanderlust is map-based, enabling users to easily navigate by selecting a city or country from the map. Upon selection, a menu appears offering two main options: "Move" for exploring relocation possibilities or "Travel" for planning trips. Each selection leads to relevant controls and information tailored to the user's choice, making UrbanWanderlust a practical tool for both prospective residents and travelers.
